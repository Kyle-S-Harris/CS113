1a. ISBN, because ISBN numbers are a universal standard of giving a specific book a unique identifier

1b. Uniform number, because only one player on a team has a specific number. If this were a case of multiple teams, then numbers could potentially overlap, so uniform number and team name should be used in that case. 

1c. Model number, since it will generally be unique to a specific device. 

1d. Section number, since it will never be used more than once during a semester. However, it could be re-used at a different time.
